Approach To Solve The Problem : 
Our approach will focus on creating a simple, user-friendly, and accessible record
keeping system specifically designed for villages, leveraging existing mobile technology 
and databases. Key steps in our approach include: 
1. Centralized Digital Record-Keeping System  
Build a centralized database that can store construction project data, such as: 
o Unique Project Id (Unique Identifier) 
o Project Name (e.g., "Drainage Line ") 
o Type of Development (e.g., roads, water pipelines) 
o Execution Dates (start and end),(Estimated  Days) 
o Status (completed, ongoing, or incomplete) 
o Associated Costs (Funds) 
o Location (Village ,Taluka ,District, State) 
o Contractor/Agency Details:- 
The database can be managed using an accessible platform, such as a simple web 
Application, ensuring usability in rural areas. 
2.  Unique Project ID 
• Assign a unique identifier for every construction project. For example: 
• A combination of village code + project type + year (e.g., "1234-Drainage-2025"). 
• This prevents duplication and simplifies record retrieval.  
3.Govt Staff /Admin Input System(log in) 
• Allow government staff or community representatives to update project details 
directly into the system. 
• Implement simple, user-friendly forms for entering project updates, ensuring 
inclusivity for those with varying tech literacy 
4.Automated Detection of Duplicates 
The system will include an algorithm that cross-references new construction entries 
with existing records to flag any duplicates based on location, project type, and 
contractor. 
5 Real-Time Updates 
Implement a system that allows users to receive notifications if similar construction 
activities are identified, providing real-time updates on potential duplications. 
6.Reporting and Analysis 
Provide a dashboard that allows local authorities and  stakeholders to analyze 
construction data, identify trends, and ensure resource optimization.
